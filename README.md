# Introduction-to-Computer-Graphics
The course covers basic subjects in Computer Graphics including the mathematical
foundations and algorithms for creating images using computers.
The course starts by describing what an image is and surveying simple image processing
operations, explains what color is and moves to geometric modeling using implicit and
parametric representations.
The mathematical subjects include: sampling and aliasing, Affine transformations,
homogeneous coordinates and projections.
The course will cover Ray Tracing algorithm and Graphical pipeline rendering using the
GPU including clipping and rasterization, lighting model and texture mapping.
